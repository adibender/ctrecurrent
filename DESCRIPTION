Description: Converts camera trap data (site, timestamp, species) into a
    recurrent event format suited for recurrent event analyses.  It
    requires to specify which species (primary, one or more) affect the
    other (secondary, only one) and the maximum duration of a survey (d).
    For each observation of the primary species, the function creates a
    survey during which all observations of the secondary species are
    recorded (i.e. the recurrent events), indicating the time of the
    previous event (t.start) and the time since the beginning of the
    survey (t.stop).
