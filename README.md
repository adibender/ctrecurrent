# ctrecurrent

The goal of ctrecurrent is to transform the camera trap data into a
format suitable for recurrent event analysis. It contains the function
recurrent() to do so, requiring a dataframe with the following
information for each observation: Site ID, Timestamp (Date and Time) and
Species.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ctrecurrent from the R-cran
or from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("APoopFinder/ctrecurrent")
```
